build_segments_call.py  (with COMBINED RCFD/RCON series)
Aggregate the full Call panel into SEGMENT buckets: ALL / 031 / 041 / 051 / size.
Adds a COMBINED line for every balance-sheet item: COMB#### = COALESCE(RCFD####,
RCON####) per bank BEFORE summing — the correct cross-form total (e.g. COMB2170 =
all-banks total assets, continuous across 031/041/051).

Setup:  pip install duckdb pandas pyarrow
Run:    python build_segments_call.py
Output: ffiec_call_segments_long.csv (+ .parquet)
